# BackTap

BackTap is a simple clone of the iOS 14 and Android 11 Beta "back tap" accessibility feature. This allows the user to double tap or triple tap the back of their phone to invoke various actions.

## Installation

You can download an APK from the releases page. Currently the APKs are manually built and uploaded but I am looking into automating this process so that the latest updates will be available at all times.

## Usage

To use BackTap, first set the double tap and triple tap actions. This is done by simply opening the app and using the drop down menus to select your desired actions. Then, use the accessibility settings button to go to your phone's settings and enable the BackTap service.
