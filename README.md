# BackTap

BackTap is a simple clone of the iOS 14 and Android 11 Beta "back tap" accessibility feature. This allows the user to double tap or triple tap the back of their phone to invoke various actions.

## Installation

Currently, I have not exported any APK's from Android Studio so you must build them yourself. Simply download this git repo and open it as a project in Android Studio. Then simply connect your device to your computer and build.

## Usage

To use BackTap, first set the double tap and triple tap actions. This is done by simply opening the app and using the drop down menus to select your desired actions. Then, use the accessibility settings button to go to your phone's settings and enable the BackTap service.

## Todo

 -Rewrite in Kotlin

 -Export APKs from Android Studio
 
 -Add a sensitivity settings
 
 -Squash whatever bugs exist
