# BackTap

BackTap is a simple clone of the iOS 14 and Android 11 Beta "back tap" accessibility feature. This allows the user to double tap or triple tap the back of their phone to invoke various actions.

## Installation

Currently, I am waiting on Google to approve of the Play Store listing. In the mean time, you are free to clone this repo and build the project within Android Studio

## Usage

To use BackTap, just select your desired double tap and triple tap actions. Then, enable the service within the accessibility settings page. Try double tapping and triple tapping the back of your phone and adjust the sensitivity as needed.

## Todo

 -Maybe add more levels of sensitivity
 
 -Squash whatever bugs exist
